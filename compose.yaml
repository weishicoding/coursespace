  # The commented out section below is an example of how to define a PostgreSQL
  # database that your application can use. `depends_on` tells Docker Compose to
  # start the database before your application. The `db-data` volume persists the
  # database data between container restarts. The `db-password` secret is used
  # to set the database password. You must create `db/password.txt` and add
  # a password of your choosing to it before running `docker-compose up`.
